# 2. Write a class called Product. The class should have fields called name, amount, and price,
# holding the productâ€™s name, the number of items of that product in stock, and the regular
# price of the product. There should be a method get_price that receives the number of
# items to be bought and returns a the cost of buying that many items, where the regular price
# is charged for orders of less than 10 items, a 10% discount is applied for orders of between
# 10 and 99 items, and a 20% discount is applied for orders of 100 or more items. There should
# also be a method called make_purchase that receives the number of items to be bought and
# decreases amount by that much.
