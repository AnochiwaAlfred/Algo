# 1. Write a class called Investment with fields called principal and interest. The construcï¿¾tor should set the values of those fields. 
# There should be a method called value_after that
# returns the value of the investment after n years. The formula for this is p(1 + i)n
# , where p is
# the principal, and i is the interest rate. It should also use the special method __str__ so that
# printing the object will result in something like below:
# Principal - $1000.00, Interest rate - 5.12%
